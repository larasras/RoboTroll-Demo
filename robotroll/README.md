<!-- Preparing -->
## Preparing Dataset
The first step for configuring RoboTroll inside the serverside is traning the dataset. Let's say we have dataset with the following structure:
| x1  | x2  |  x3 |  ... |  y |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  1 |  x21 |  x31 | ...  |  y1 |
|  1 |  x22 |  x32 |  ... |  y2 |
|  ... |  ... | ...  | ...  | ...  |
|  n |  x2n |  x3n | ...  |  yn |
X variable is the difference between two request times which user/robot does. Y has two values which is 0 for human, and one for robot.

<!-- Training and Testing -->
## Training and Testing
After we have the dataset, then we give that dataset to the learning algorithm for classification. Leaning algorithm will produce theta for prediction need.

For training example see the [demo](https://github.com/larasras/RoboTroll-Demo)

To see the testing result, use a confusion matrix and calculate accuracy and F1-score. The logic is the more we have features the smarter RoboTroll will detect the robot.

Based on the training we have done in the demo, we have 100% accuracy and F1-score (using 10 features), and 94% accuracy and F1-score (using 5 features).

<!-- Configuring -->
## Configuring RoboTroll
The last step is cofiguring the RoboTroll module inside our serverside. Configuring the module is very easy because the module has flexibility. The logic is we must store the timestamp for each user do request. We can use session/database/others secure storage for storing it.

For each request user do, predict the user is a robot or not using the timestamp we stored before.
